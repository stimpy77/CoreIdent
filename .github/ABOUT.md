# GitHub Configuration

This folder will contain GitHub Actions workflows and other configuration once implementation is restored.

## Planned Workflows

- **CI Build** — Build and test on push/PR
- **Release** — Publish NuGet packages on tag

See [DEVPLAN.md](../docs/0.4/DEVPLAN.md) for the implementation roadmap.
